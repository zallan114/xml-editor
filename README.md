# XML_Editor

using this tool to edit or view xml file.   

get inspiration from another old vue2 js project.  Later based on vue3 dev tool, re-organized this one. Hope it can help for general XML editor.

personally working on java backend more than 10 years, By chance,  got familiar with Vue. I like its design. It's efficient and the code is concise...

good luck!
